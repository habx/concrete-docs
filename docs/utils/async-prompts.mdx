title: Async prompts

## Why async prompts ?

Sometimes we need to get user confirmation after a form submission or any other interaction.
Borwsers have built-in functions like `confirm` that can get user validation but it won't be style.
With React it can be a pain to add a validation modal after submition. We came up with functions helpers inspired by
[sweeetAlert](https://sweetalert2.github.io/) that help us adding confirmation modals or even more complexe form called
asynchronously.

## Confirm
**Concrete** exports a `confirm` function that return a _promise_ waiting for user response.

### Usage


```jsx
import { confirm, notify, Button } from '@habx/ui-core'

const MyComponent = () => {
  const handleSubmit = async () => {
    const hasConfirmed = confirm('Do you want to confirm ?')
    notify(`User response ${hasConfirmed ? 'yes' : 'no'}`)
  }

  return <Button onClick={handleSubmit}>Click Me!</Button>
}

```

import { confirm, notify, Button, Provider } from '@habx/ui-core'
export const BasicConfirmUsage = () => {
  const handleSubmit = async () => {
    const hasConfirmed = await confirm({ message: 'Do you want to confirm ?', confirmLabel: 'Yes', cancelLabel: 'No' })
    notify(`User response is ${hasConfirmed ? 'yes' : 'no'}`)
  }
  return<Provider>
    <Button onClick={handleSubmit}>Click Me!</Button>
  </Provider>
}

<BasicConfirmUsage />
